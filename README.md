# PROJECT NAME
To-do App
## Description
Time to complete project: 25 hours

This project is a user-friendly to-do checklist application,
with a focus on connections between the client and the server
using POST,GET,PUT, and DELETE methods.
I began by setting up my server and importing my necessary modules
and creating the barebones structure for my index.html.

## Usage
Users will be able to input new tasks, add notes, mark whether the
task is complete or not, and delete the task from the DOM (and consequently, the database). This application is viewport friendly,and can handle any standard width sizing.
