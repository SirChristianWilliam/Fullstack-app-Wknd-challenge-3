Create HTML structure.
I will use checkboxes for the inputs.
I should create a table container for the entries.
A form w/container will be needed for the inputs. 
All tasks will start with the boolean of false.
I should have an input box to enter in the task. 
A submit button to append that data. 
A checkbox is for visual marking as complete, the delete button 
will be for immediate deletion. 
When appended, there will be the checkbox to mark whether
the task is complete, and whether it should be deleted. 
The delete will be a button. 

I will use a GET post to first append the history. 
I will return to that GET post every time I click the
checkbox, press submit, or delete. 
I will use a POST request to append the new data every submit. 
I will use a DELETE request to delete the row.
I will use a PUT request to toggle the checkbox and the boolean,
as it is changing the existing data.
I will have a routes folder, not sure if I will need one 
files within, or more yet. 
Prevent default for the form submits.  

FOR IF I HAVE TIME AND A GOOD GRASP ON THIS:

Create an add note button that will append a task row,
and the client will be able to type in what the task is
in that input box, which will start as blank. I could do this 
by using a data() method for the inputs while appending
to each row. This way, it will have a unique id of some 
sort. Then the submit button could be in that same row,
and once clicked, it will solidify that input row. I have an
idea how to do all this, but I will do the basics first.
